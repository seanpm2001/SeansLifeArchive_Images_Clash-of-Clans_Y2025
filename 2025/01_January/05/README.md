### 2022, Sunday, February 6th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading some walls to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, and began to build a second inferno tower. I am now capable of upgrading to town hall 11, but may possibly not do so, as I am already really low on space, and I also heard about a 100 building limit. There was 1 new gembox today. I got attacked twice since I last played, both attacks were unsuccessful. That was about it. - 2022 Sunday February 6th

I did not do any other upgrades today, and there were no gem boxes. I am starting to run low on town hall 10 building upgrades. I intend to upgrade my level 8 mortar to become a multi-mortar next, and I began saving up for it today. I decided not to wait for all 3 million gold and below upgraded to go first. I got attacked once since I last played, but it was an unsuccessful attack (just a single archer being deployed) - 2022 May 1st

### 2022, Sunday, May 8th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading some more walls (4) to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, and began upgrading my level 8 mortar to a multi-mortar for 8 million gold. I became really bummed out, as I spent 1246 gems to get the remaining gold for the upgrade. Despite the fact that the gems won't get spent on anything if this doesn't happen, it is still hard to lose 1000 gems, especially as a free to play. The upgrade will complete in 2 weeks. I spent nearly half an hour or longer collecting from gold mines and elixir collectors, so that I would have some resources stocked up further in the base. It was pretty pointless, but I used to enjoy doing this a long time ago from time to time. The game had to be updates today. Also, I accidentally deleted screenshots 51 to 100 before the transfer, they no longer exist, and I am very disappointed in myself. - 2022 May 8th

### 2022, Sunday, May 15th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading some more walls (5) to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, and began upgrading a skeleton trap to max level 4 for 1.5 million gold. My mult-mortar still has over 168 hours left, so next Sunday (due to my recent schedule shift) I am going to have to remember to wait an extra hour before playing. The upgrade is about halfway done. - 2022 May 15th

### 2022, Sunday, May 22nd

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading some more walls (at least 7) to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, and for 2 walls 500,000 gold each, and began upgrading a second mortar to level 8 for 3.0 million gold. My mult-mortar still had a little over half an hour left upon resuming, so I went and did things in the builder base, and waited for the countdown. After the upgrade finished, I was able to upgrade O.T.T.O to level 2, which I originally thought could only be done once all the objectives were reached. The upgrade did nothing.

I earned an achievement for gearing up 3 buildings, and was able to level up to level 126. There were no gemboxes today. - 2022 May 22nd

### 2022, Sunday, May 29th

There was 1 gembox today, I discovered it much later on. - 2022 May 29th

### 2022, Sunday, June 5th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading a hidden tesla to level 8 for 2.5 million gold, and a third barracks to level 12 for 2.5 million elixir. There was 1 gembox today, I discovered it much earlier on. Today, I didn't do any wall upgrades, I should get back to these after I upgrade the 4th barracks to level 12. To afford the upgrade today, I had to take some troops out of my barracks queue. I did this after starting the upgrade as well, so I would have extra resources next week, in case I don't remember the barracks queue. I stayed around for a long time after doing my versus battles, collection is fun, and it was just relaxing leisure gameplay. - 2022, Sunday, June 5th

### 2022, Sunday, June 12th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading 2 spring traps to max level 4 for 1.2 million gold each, 2.4 million gold total, and a fourth and final barracks to level 12 for 2.5 million elixir. I should get back to wall upgrades next week. Today, I wanted to upgrade another hidden tesla to level 8, but I couldn't afford it, and I intend to not spend my gems. There weren't any gemboxes today. Today, I didn't do any wall upgrades. I also toured a max level base to see what things are like, I don't like the look of TH14 very much - 2022, Sunday, June 12th

### 2022, Sunday, June 19th

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading 1 spring trap to max level 4 for 1.2 million gold, and 1 hidden bomb to level 7 for 1 million gold.  There was 1 gembox today. Today, I upgraded 4 walls to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, 2,000,000 elixir total. - 2022, Sunday, June 19th

There was 1 gembox today. Today, I upgraded 5 walls to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, 2,500,000 elixir total.

I started off with over 2.9 million gold, and after collection, I nearly had enough to upgrade my town hall to level 11 (5.5 million gold) but decided to do other upgrades. The game forced me to update before I could play. Unfortunately, the update removed all flags from the game. - 2022, Sunday, June 26th

### 2022, Sunday, July 3rd

I did some upgrades in my main village, a wizard tower to level 8 for 3.2 million gold, something I have wanted to do for a long time (since my iOS era of Clash of Clans gameplay) along with a seeking air mine to level 2 for 1 million gold. I couldn't afford any more gold upgrades this week, the leftover 1m+ gold will be useful for upgrades next week. I also upgraded 5 walls to level 11 for 500,000 elixir each, 2,500,000 elixir total. There were no gemboxes today - 2022, Sunday, July 3rd

I almost couldn't upgrade my X-BOW this week, as I didn't notice the free 500k gold until near the end of my session. I also moved one of my archer towers in preparation for town hall 11, although I left a vulnerable opening in my base in the process. I doubt anyone my rank could penetrate my base through this, plus I don't get invaded anymore anyways. If a rusher or dropper attempts to attack in this location, the attack will likely be expelled quickly, unless they have troop levels similar to mine. I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Sunday, March 5th

### 2023, Sunday, March 12th

I could not afford any upgrades in my main village today. I am getting close to being a maxed out town hall 10 player, and I am really excited for town hall 11. There are 5 building upgrades left before I am a max town hall 10 player (unless the dark barracks is capable of being upgraded to level 8, then there are 6 upgrades left) I still intend to max out all buildings before upgrading to town hall 11, with the 2 exceptions being the heroes (Barbarian King and Archer Queen) along with laboratory upgrades. There was 1 gembox available this week. I also sold some magic items this week. I waited around and collected resources, and went through the upgrades available once I get to town hall 11.

I had a long session today. I am getting close to being a maxed out town hall 10 player, and I am really excited for town hall 11. There are 3 building upgrades left before I am a max town hall 10 player (unless the dark barracks is capable of being upgraded to level 8, then there are 5 upgrades left) I still intend to max out all buildings before upgrading to town hall 11, with the 2 exceptions being the heroes (Barbarian King and Archer Queen) along with laboratory upgrades. There was 1 gembox available this week. I upgraded a wizard tower to level 9 today for 3.7 million gold, and a dark barracks to level 7 for 4 million elixir. I got attacked since I last played, and surprisingly, the attack was successful. The attacker took advantage of the little gap I left up in my village, which was a huge weakness, but they weren't able to get 2 stars (they got 49%, 1 star) I just didn't expect someone of this level to go after me. I temporarily moved buildings to cover any openings to prevent this from happening again. Luckily, I didn't lose very many resources. I also sold some magic items this week. I waited around briefly and collected resources. I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Sunday, March 19th

There was 1 gembox available this week. I upgraded my clan castle to level 6, and a 3rd wizard tower to level 9.

I upgraded the last building today (wizard tower level 9) but it won't be completed until next week.  There was 1 gembox available this week. I spent a very long time playing this week, as it took longer in the builder base, and I also played the offline campaign for a while, and was almost able to upgrade my town hall to level 11 today, but then ran low on battery, and quit. I decided not to come back to it this week, as I want to see my base entirely maxed out before I start the upgrade. I did not get attacked since I last played.

I had a normal length session today. I am now a max town hall 10, and I am really excited for town hall 11. I never thought I would achieve this in Clash of Clans, but I am a max level town hall 10 player. I remember this being an achievement most people only got by paying tons of money. For the most part, I have done this as a free to play. I may have spent some money in the past, but no more than $40. I am excited for town hall 11 I began upgrading my town hall to level 11 today, and also began upgrading my barbarian to level 7 for 2.1 million elixir, as I almost had an overflow. I moved the master building to my main village, so that I can do 6 upgrades a week. I plan to upgrade my gold mines and elixir collectors for the first 3 weeks of town hall 11, while also doing other upgrades. There weren't any gemboxes available this week. I did not get attacked since I last played. I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Sunday, April 16th

### 2023, Sunday, April 23rd

I had a long length session today. I reached town hall 11 today. The new town hall level showed up as an achievement on the screen, but due to edge screen issues, I couldn't get a screenshot of it. I began building all of the new buildings, except for the Eagle Artillery. I plan to upgrade my gold mines and elixir collectors for the first 3 weeks of town hall 11, while also doing other upgrades. I only upgraded 4 gold mines this week, I decided it would be better this way. I built a new wizard tower and XBOW today, along with a new cannon and archer tower. I also built a Grand Warden housing, and unlocked the Grand Warden. I also built 25 new walls, and got all of them to level 6, along with an outer layer of level 7 walls, and a new level 11 wall. I don't have anywhere to build, so these walls are just in a random part of my village. They will likely be moved in the future. I also moved my barracks and spell factories back into the corners of the village, and built a tornado trap. Additionally, I began to upgrade my freeze spell to level 3. There was 1 gembox available this week. I came very close to level 133 today. I did not get attacked since I last played. I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Sunday, April 23rd

I began to upgrade my lava hound to level 3 as well. There weren't any gemboxes available this week. I leveled up to level 133 since I last played today. I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Sunday, April 30th

### 2023, Sunday, May 7th

I had a very long length session today.

I did not get attacked since I last played.

I received a large amount of loot from the season ending.

I plan to upgrade my gold mines and elixir collectors for the first 3 weeks of town hall 11, while also doing other upgrades.

I upgraded 3 elixir collectors this week, but couldn't upgrade the final elixir collector, so I am saving that for next week.

I also upgraded my Clan Castle to level 7, and 2 gold storages to level 12.

I did not do any wall upgrades today.

I saved up 5.3 million gold before quitting, so that no matter what happens, I will be able to afford to build the Eagle Artillery next week.

There was 1 gembox available today, I had to cancel an upgrade, and clean it up, then resume the upgrade.

I leveled up to level 134 since I last played today, I feel these level-ups will be frequent for a little while.

I also did some single player challenges today, completing the last 4 available for a town hall 11 player.

I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Sunday, May 7th

I had a very long length session today.

I did not get attacked since I last played.

I began to build an Eagle Artillery building today for 6 million gold, it was a lot bigger than expected, and I had to move several things to fit it inside my base.

I finished upgrading gold mines and elixir collectors today, although technically it will be done by next week, as I began to upgrade the last elixir collector this week.

I also began to upgrade a dark elixir drill to level 8.

Additionally, I upgraded my laboratory to level 9, a gold storage building to level 12, and an elixir storage building to level 12.

Earlier in the session, I upgraded my newest archer tower to level 3, and my newest cannon to level 4.

I also began upgrading my bowler to level 2 in the laboratory, while it was being upgraded to level 9. 

I didn't know this was possible (to upgrade something in the laboratory while the laboratory itself is upgrading)

I did not do any wall upgrades today.

There were no gem boxes available this week.

I did not level up this week.

I did lots of collection, out of a mixture of procrastination, addiction, and boredom.

I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Sunday, May 14th

I had a very long length session today.

I did not get attacked since I last played.

The game had a massive update before I could start playing. It did a massive change to the builder base, where attacks are done in 2 phases. My base was completely moved around, and I can't revert it. I don't like it very much, but I don't have the strongest dislike for it. I miss the old builder base. It also feels like I am now earning less per week in the builder base.

It additionally felt weird going from the builder base to my home village, it normally isn't too much of an optical change for me. There were also lots of graphical changes, and times to how long it takes for buildings to upgrade.

I did many upgrades this week, and used a builder potion. I upgraded a cannon to level 5, then to level 6, and then to level 7, an archer tower to level 4, then to level 5, a wizard tower to level 2 and then level 3, an X-BOW to level 2, an elixir storage to level 12, a gold storage to level 12, my grand warden to level 2, and several walls to level 7, 8, and 9.

There was 1 gem box available this week.

I leveled up to level 135 this week.

I waited out the entire builder potion boost, and continued to play.

I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Sunday, May 21st

### 2023, Sunday, May 28th

I had a very long length session today.

I did not get attacked since I last played.

I started the session strongly disliking the new builder base, but became a lot friendlier towards it later on.

I did many upgrades this week. I upgraded a cannon to level 8, an archer tower to level 6, a wizard tower to level 4, 2 elixir storage structures to level 12, and several walls to level 8 and 9.

I began to upgrade O.T.T.Os outpost to level 3. So far, nobody has reached 100% or more on my builder base, which is odd.

There was 1 gem box available this week.

### 2023, Sunday, June 4th

I had a very long length session today.

I did not get attacked since I last played.

I have been dreading playing the game due to the new builder base. The home village is much more fun now.

### 2023, Sunday, July 16th

I had a long length session again today.

I did not get attacked since I last played.

I forced myself to have time to play today, and had fun. I have been skipping most of my gaming sessions this week due to time and battery issues, but I am now allowed to skip my Clash of Clans or Boom Beach sessions, as per Waffle House Index rules.
 
I did 5 upgrades this week, with only 1 building upgrade. I upgraded a cannon to level 13, a skeleton spell to level 4, and 3 walls to level 13. Just 294 to go...

### 2023, Sunday, July 23rd

I had a long length session again today.

I got attacked 3 times since I last played, of which all 3 were unsuccessful, but resulted in significant resource losses. I could have done other upgrades today if it wasn't for this, although I don't think it would have had an effect, as gold mines, elixir collectors, and dark elixir drills can only hold so much.

My session started much later in the day today, as my vacation significantly threw me off today.

I did 3 upgrades this week, with only 1 building upgrade. I upgraded a cannon to level 15, and 2 walls to level 13. Just 292 to go...

My session started much earlier in the day today compared to last week.

### 2023, Sunday, August 13th

I had a long length session again today.

I got attacked 3 times since I last played, 1 attack was successful, while the other 2 were only successful in stealing resources. I was surprised by how far one person got solely with super goblins, wall bombers, jump and lightning spells. The 1 successful attack was also disappointing, as the player that won was nearly 3x lower level than me (being level 54) they seem to prioritize offensives only, as their main base was a town hall 11, with every single defensive building being level 1. It doesn't seem fair how powerful level 2 electrodragons are. There is no way I can defend against them (kind of like my all-night witch builder base attacks, but those are not nearly as effective)

My session started earlier in the day today compared to last week.

I did only 2 upgrades this week, with 1 building upgrade, upgrading my wizard tower to level 7, and upgrading 1 wall to level 13. Just 286 to go...

I was considering upgrading an archer tower to level 13, but felt that this wizard tower was more important for the time.

I plan to upgrade the other geared up defense (archer tower) soon. I am able to do fewer upgrades per week.

There weren't any gemboxes available this week. I had a 11 year Clash of Clans anniversary trophy placed in my village though. I have so many of these game trophies (not only the 11 year anniversary one) that nothing but gemboxes are capable of appearing in my village.

I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Sunday, August 13th

### 2023, Sunday, August 20th

I was considering upgrading an archer tower to level 13 yet again, but felt that this wizard tower was more important for the time.

### 2023, Sunday, August 27th

I had a long length session again today.

I was attacked once since I last played, which prevented me from doing the upgrade I wanted (Wizard tower level 9) and instead upgrading a mortar to level 9 for 3.5 million gold.

I did only 3 upgrades this week, doing only building upgrades, upgrading a mortar to level 9, my barbarian king to level 32, a 2nd dark elixir drill to level 8, and upgrading 0 walls to level 13. Still 283 to go...

I moved some buildings around, putting more splash damage defenses closer to my eastern walls, and moving some elixir collectors and gold mines a little further in. I also put my higher level dark elixir drills into the town hall citadel region.

I was considering upgrading an archer tower to level 13 yet again, but felt that there were too many other upgrades that needed to be done, and since the Archer Tower upgrades are cheap compared to the mortar upgrade, I decided to hold it off.

I plan to upgrade the other geared up defense (archer tower) eventually. I am able to do fewer upgrades per week.

There was 1 gem box available this week.

### 2023, Sunday, September 10th

I had a long length session again today.

I did not get attacked since I last played, but I still did a cheap(ish) upgrading an archer tower to level 14. I am excited to see what a level 15 archer tower will look like.

I did only 3 upgrades this week, doing more than just building upgrades this week, upgrading an archer tower to level 14, my grand warden to level 4, and also 1 wall to level 13. Still 282 to go...

I estimate that it will take about 10 to 11 more weeks to upgrade the rest of my Archer towers to level 15, at a cost of 27.5 million gold. I likely will want to take a break from doing this consecutively.

There was a UI overhaul today, it is a lot less helpful and clunky, and I miss the old UI.

There was a new event that introduced sour elixir. I am hoping it doesn't make my village more prone to attack.

I would say it is more effective than the wall breaker/bomber. There are so many easy ways to destroy or jump over walls, it makes you wonder why the majority of upgrades in the game are done to wall segments.

During this, I noted that dark elixir is an extremely valuable resource: 4 dark elixir is equivalent to 1 gem (for speeding upgrades/buying upgrades) if you managed to take 4,000 dark elixir from someone in an attack, that is equivalent to taking 1,000 gems worth of resources.

### Home village battles

<!-- No data available for home village battles at the moment, new section. - 2022, Sunday, May 29th !-->

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

- I did not start any battles in the home village, or get attacked by anyone since I last played. - 2022, Sunday, May 29th to 2022, Sunday, October 30th
- I feel like I am not visible to other players for attacks at all anymore. I did not start any battles in the home village, or get attacked by anyone since I last played. - 2022, Sunday, November 6th to 2023, Sunday, February 26th
- Well nevermind on that statement, after nearly a full year, someone attacked my base. Surprisingly, the attack was successful. The attacker took advantage of the little gap I left up in my village, which was a huge weakness, as lots of vital air defense was vulnerable, and it left open a quicker route to the town hall. The attacker wasn't able to get 2 stars (they got 49%, 1 star) I just didn't expect someone of this level to go after me. I temporarily moved buildings to cover any openings to prevent this from happening again. Luckily, I didn't lose very many resources. - 2023, Sunday, March 19th
- I did not get attacked since I last played. - 2023, Sunday, March 26th
- I got attacked since I last played, my base was 100% destroyed by another town hall 10 player, who was much less advanced (their base was much lower level compared to mine) I didn't lose very many resources. - 2023, Sunday, April 2nd
- I did not get attacked since I last played. - 2023, Sunday, April 9th to Sunday, April 23rd
- I got attacked since I last played, my base was 100% destroyed. I didn't lose very many resources. - 2023, Sunday, April 30th
- I did not get attacked since I last played. - 2023, Sunday, May 7th to 2023, Sunday, July 16th
- I got attacked 3 times since I last played, of which all 3 were unsuccessful, but resulted in significant resource losses. I could have done other upgrades today if it wasn't for this, although I don't think it would have had an effect, as gold mines, elixir collectors, and dark elixir drills can only hold so much. - 2023, Sunday, July 23rd
- I did not get attacked since I last played. - 2023, Sunday, August 6th
- I got attacked 3 times since I last played, 1 attack was successful, while the other 2 were only successful in stealing resources. I was surprised by how far one person got solely with super goblins, wall bombers, jump and lightning spells. The 1 successful attack was also disappointing, as the player that won was nearly 3x lower level than me (being level 54) they seem to prioritize offensives only, as their main base was a town hall 11, with every single defensive building being level 1. It doesn't seem fair how powerful level 2 electrodragons are. There is no way I can defend against them (kind of like my all-night witch builder base attacks, but those are not nearly as effective) I lost millions of units of gold and elixir. - 2023, Sunday, August 13th
- I did not get attacked since I last played. - 2023, Sunday, August 20th

## Builder base

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

### 2021, Sunday. October 17th and below

Unavailable in this README version.

### 2021, Sunday, October 24th

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse, and it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my builder barracks to level 11 for 2,000,000 elixir. It will unlock the hog glider, which I may try out. I just wanted to do an upgrade today. Next week, I will be upgrading my multi-mortar to level 8 for 3.5 million gold. - 2021 Sunday October 24th

### 2021, Sunday, October 31st

Today in the builder base, I did really well, getting 3 3 star attacks in a row, but after that, it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my multi-mortar to level 8 for 3.5 million gold. - 2021 Sunday October 31st

### 2021, Sunday, November 7th

Today in the builder base, I did well, taking me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my elixir to level 9 for 2.5 million gold. - 2021 Sunday November 7th

### 2021, Sunday, November 14th

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse, and it took me a while to get 6 wins. After getting 6 wins, I upgraded my battle machine to level 22 for 3.2 million elixir. I am just upgrading it to see if it can get at all better, and so I can unlock O.T.T.O. I have come to the conclusion that the Battle Machine is the worst hero in the game, as it always goes out of its way to kill itself, either going directly to a crusher, or walking through 6 buildings and getting shot 200 times, then dying without hitting anything. It still is decent in some ways (it is better than nothing) but I still consider it the worst hero to have. - 2021 Sunday November 14th

### 2021, Sunday, November 21st

Today in the builder base, I did well, and it didn't take very long to get 6 wins, as I had multiple trophy droppers go against me in a row.

### 2023, Sunday, February 19th

Today in the builder base, I did a lot worse compared to last week. It took less than 24 minutes to get to 6 wins.

I thought the level 5 lava launcher was a cool upgrade (making the stones surrounding the lava pit straight and not gravel) but the level 6 lava launcher looks so much better. This is my next planned upgrade. It will also bring the hitpoints past 1000. A new goal I have is to max out all of the buildings in the core region of my base (the first layer of buildings surrounding the builder hall) I didn't do any other upgrades today. - 2023, Sunday, February 19th

I dropped down 63 trophies to 2,868 trophies today, having a load of losses. I thought that the gem mine upgrade not being finalized until I returned would cause me to not be able to collect from it. I was wrong on this. I was hoping to get so much gold today that after finishing attacks, my coffers would be completely full, and there were would be a red gold icon. I got very, very close, but didn't reach this. A recent goal I have is to max out all of the buildings in the core region of my base (the first layer of buildings surrounding the builder hall) I upgraded my lava launcher to level 6 today for 4 million gold, after I finished my 6 successful battles.

I plan on upgrading my lava launcher to level 8 next. I used a clock tower potion, and then some additional time, so I didn't have to use any gems on the upgrade. I didn't upgrade any buoldings this week. A new goal I have is to max out all of the buildings in the core region of my base (the first layer of buildings surrounding the builder hall) - 2023, Sunday, April 2nd

I dropped down 148 trophies to 2,856 trophies today, having a very poor battle record. I decided to cancel my plans on a level 8 lava launcher, as I was reading about the changes to the builder base, and I decided to go back to normal upgrades again, upgrading my clock tower to level 9 for 2.7 million gold. A new goal I have is to max out all of the buildings in the core region of my base (the first layer of buildings surrounding the builder hall) this goal is currently paused. - 2023, Sunday, April 9th

### 2023, Sunday, April 16th

### 2023, Sunday, May 14th

Today in the builder base, I did a bit worse compared to last week. It took a long time to get to 6 wins. I activated my clock tower later on, as I forgot to activate it, activating it before getting a 4th successful battle completed. I dropped down 144 trophies (from 3,072 to 2,928 trophies) today, having a very mixed battle record. I began to upgrade my Hog Glider to level 6, and a guard post to level 7. The guard post upgrade will be useful, as it will create 2 more distraction troops, and also increase their level. I have noted that the battle machine constantly commits suicide against crushers and guard posts, so this will be a helpful, but frustrating deterrant. A new goal I have is to max out all of the buildings in the core region of my base (the first layer of buildings surrounding the builder hall) this goal is currently paused. - 2023, Sunday, May 14th

### 2023, Sunday, May 21st

The game had a massive update before I could start playing. It did a massive change to the builder base, where attacks are done in 2 phases. My base was completely moved around, and I can't revert it. I don't like it very much, but I don't have the strongest dislike for it. I miss the old builder base. It also feels like I am now earning less per week in the builder base.

It additionally felt weird going from the builder base to my home village, it normally isn't too much of an optical change for me. There were also lots of graphical changes, and times to how long it takes for buildings to upgrade. I began to upgrade the outpost to level 2, and also build a new structure. I did fewer battles, and won every time. - 2023, Sunday, May 21st

### 2023, Sunday, May 28th

I began to upgrade O.T.T.Os outpost to level 3, and quickly gained 18 stars. I used my clock tower boost, and began cleaning up some obstacles again this week. I didn't make very much progress.

### 2023, Sunday, June 4th

I began to upgrade O.T.T.Os outpost to level 3, and quickly gained 18 stars. I used my clock tower boost after the first battle, and began cleaning up some obstacles again this week. I didn't make very much progress. - 2023, Sunday, June 4th

I plan on building a reinforcement camp next. - 2023, Sunday, June 11th

### 2023, Sunday, June 18th

I did some attacks, and quickly gained 18 stars. I used my clock tower boost before the first battle, and began cleaning up some obstacles again this week. I didn't make very much progress. I began building a reinforcement camp today. Next, I plan to build the battle copter, then upgrade my builder hall to level 10. If I begin to overflow on gold, I will likely upgrade O.T.T.O.s outpost to level 5. - 2023, Sunday, June 18th

### 2023, Sunday, June 25th

I did some attacks, and quickly gained 19 stars. I used my clock tower boost before the first battle, and did not clean up obstacles this week. I began to upgrade O.T.T.Os outpost to level 5, while the reinforcement camp was still building, and will finish next week. I didn't make very much progress. I reached steel III today, which increased my battle rewards, and upped the star requirement. I also reorganized part 2 of my base, as I noted some weakness. Phase 1 of my builder base is a fortress, while phase 2 is a town. - 2023, Sunday, June 25th

### 2023, Sunday, July 2nd

I did some attacks, and quickly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost before the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week. I built the battle copter today. I didn't make very much progress. I stayed in steel III today. The game randomly had a server error near the end, despite no Wi-Fi problems, so it looks like Clash of Clans is going to become like Boom Beach in that regard. - 2023, Sunday, July 2nd

### 2023, Sunday, July 9th

I did some attacks, and quickly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost after the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week. I didn't make very much progress.

### 2023, Sunday, July 16th

I did some attacks, and slowly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost after the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week. I didn't make very much progress. I made it to Steel II today, but had significant struggles, as the opponents have been getting too difficult. I had my first new builder base failure, where I did a battle that gained 0 stars. The battle started in the cave base for some reason, and not the grass base. I built a new mine, and upgraded it to level 2, level 3, and finally level 4. I also upgraded a gold mine to level 10, and an elixir collector to level 10, as I recently got to max builder hall level 10. I am 88 trophies away from reaching my all-time record again. - 2023, Sunday, July 16th

### 2023, Sunday, July 23rd

I did some attacks, and slowly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost before the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week. I didn't make very much progress.

They weren't as bad this week. I had my second new builder base failure, where I did a battle that gained 0 stars. The battle did not start in the cave base this time. I also upgraded 2 gold mines to level 10. I am 69 trophies away from reaching my all-time record again. - 2023, Sunday, July 23rd

I had significant success in battle, winning all battles I started. I reached a new all-time builder base trophy record of 3499, beating my previous all-time record by 4 trophies, and staying in Steel II. I would likely be unable to do this if it wasn't for the Builder Base II update. I also began upgrading 2 elixir collectors to level 10. I plan to save up for an X-BOW next. - 2023, Sunday, July 30th

### 2023, Sunday, August 6th

I did some attacks, and swiftly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost before the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week.

I reached another new all-time builder base trophy record of 3,589 (but dropping to 3,556, as the last win doesn't count) beating my previous all-time record by 90 trophies, and staying in Steel II. I would likely be unable to do this if it wasn't for the Builder Base II update. I also began building a new X-BOW, and upgrading my star laboratory to level 10. I didn't do anything else here this week. - 2023, Sunday, August 6th

### 2023, Sunday, August 13th

I did some attacks, and slowly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost before the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week. I had less success in battle, doing poorly in most battles, but surprisingly winning many of them. I dropped down 16 trophies (to 3,548 trophies) due to a mixed battle record. The X-BOW finished building shortly after I arrived in the Builder Base, while the Star Laboratory was still upgrading. I began to upgrade a mine to level 5 for 50,000 gold a bit into the clock tower boost. I also toured the base of someone who attacked my main village. I didn't do anything else here this week. - 2023, Sunday, August 13th

### 2023, Sunday, August 20th

I did some attacks, and quickly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost before the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week.

### 2023, Sunday, August 27th

I did some attacks, and slowly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost before the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week.

### 2023, Sunday, September 3rd

I did some attacks, and quickly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost before the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week. I had more success in battle, doing pretty well in early battles, and a bit worse in later battles. I rose up 18 trophies (to 3,578 trophies) due to a mixed battle record. I began to upgrade a mine to level 8, and a gold mine to level 10, to add more defense around the outpost (as 300 hitpoints can slow down an offensive, and in some cases, can even determine a battle) I didn't do anything else here this week. - 2023, Sunday, September 3rd

### 2023, Sunday, September 10th

I did some attacks, and slowly gained 20 stars. I used my clock tower boost after the first battle, and cleaned up some obstacles this week.

I did mostly night witch spamming yet again today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did a lot better than last week today, and it took a lot less time to get 6 wins. I even got 5 wins in a row. I did not do any experimental attacks with different troop layouts. I went up to 2881 trophies today due to lots of battle success and failure. There was 1 battle that I lost where I had a single bat left, untargeted by any defenses. I did the community a favor and didn't wait for the bat to get killed or run out of time, I just promptly ended the battle. I wouldn't have won anyways (as of ending the battle, we both had the same percentage, but my opponent had a second star). I suggest anyone who does strategies like "sneaky archers" or runs into a situation where it takes more than 10 seconds to destroy a single building to just end the battle. Don't waste peoples time. - 2022, Sunday, March 27th

I did mostly night witch spamming yet again today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies, I did worse compared to last week today, and it took more time to get to 6 wins. I rose up 2 trophies today (to 3,004) due to lots of battle success and failure. The battle machine is not the best most of the time. It seems like a wreckless, suicidal minitank that goes for everything that kills it, and often goes away from the troops it should be protecting. The 5122 health isn't that much of an advantage, even with the health recovery, as it can get destroyed very quickly when going against high level bases, sometimes before I can even boost it once or twice. Judging by this, I don't even think a level 80 battle machine would be too much more helpful by itself. It has been failing to protect my night witches lately, and as usual, goes straight for the crusher. - 2023, Sunday, April 2nd

## 3D Touch issues

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

- While playing today, I constantly dealt with issues related to my posture of holding the device (which caused constant errors, and sporadic screengrabs) and the return of an annoying bug that made the game do nothing but zoom in and out with little control. The only fix is to turn the screen off, back on, quickly minimize the game, maximimize it, then quickly turn the screen off again, back on, quickly minimize the game again, and maximize it. It was so annoying. Sometimes it would start doing it again after the next screengrab. - 2021, Sunday, November 28th

## Clan capital

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

- So last week (2022, Sunday, May 8th) Clash of Clans had an update I forgot to mention until now (2022, Sunday, May 15th, but I didn't write about it until 2022, Wednesday, May 18th) the clan capital seems to be a new gamemode, but since my clan is and always will be inactive, there is no way I can get the clan to level 2 to unlock this region. I did not visit the clan capital today. - 2022, Sunday, May 15th
- Read above entry. I did not visit the clan capital today, as I haven't unlocked it yet. - 2022, Sunday, May 22nd to 2023, Sunday, September 10th
- I have had a little interest in the clan capital, after listening to Clash of Clans music this week, and thinking on it. Unfortunately, I will never get to play with it. - 2023, Sunday, October 8th
- I did not go to the Clan Capital today, as my Clan isn't capable of it. - 2023, Sunday, October 22nd to 2024, Sunday, December 22nd

</details>

- I did not go to the Clan Capital today, as my Clan isn't capable of it. It is disappointing that I keep earning capital gold, but it just disintegrates when I collect it. - 2024, Sunday, December 29th to 2025, Sunday, January 5th

## SUPERCELL ID

I created my SUPERCELL ID today to make backing this game up an easier process, and to get 50 gems. I really like the level of thought that was put into the cosmetics of the SUPERCELL ID Account. I would go on and apply it to my Boom Beach account. - 2024, Sunday, October 13th

## ProtonDrive comments

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

- ProtonDrive recently began acting up, and is stalling on large uploads 100 megabytes or larger. I had to split the image inodes into groups of 50 compared to the normal groups of 100, and didn't correct this, as I felt like changing it up. - 2022 Sunday, May 8th
- I am still using this system. - 2022, Sunday, May 15th to 2022, Sunday, May 22nd
- I stopped using this system due to ProtonDrive having a bad day, which caused me to go back to pCloud temporarily. I might stay with pCloud now. - 2022, Sunday, May 29th
- As of this entry, I am still using pCloud. - 2022, Sunday, June 5th to 2023, Sunday, March 12th
- As of this entry, I am still using pCloud. There were some severe issues yesterday, and I thought I would be using ProtonDrive today, but it got cleared up. - 2022, Sunday, March 19th
- As of this entry, I am still using pCloud. - 2023, Sunday, March 26th to 2024, Sunday, February 18th
- As of this entry, I am still using pCloud. However, ProtonDrive has improved significantly since, and I am considering switching over. - 2024, Sunday, February 25th to 2024, Sunday, April 28th
- Due to repeated upload failures today, I decided to switch to ProtonDrive for todays upload. It works way better, and I should have done this sooner. The upload speed is much faster, and there were no errors. - 2024, Sunday, May 5th

- As of this entry, I am still using ProtonDrive, instead of pCloud. - 2024, Sunday, May 12th to 2025, Sunday, January 5th

## Case comments

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse older entries</p></summary>

- I did not play with my new PDA case today, as I didn't remember to put it back on (I would keep it on, but it refuses to charge with the case on, despite being completely capable (it charged at least 4% before giving an error message, telling me to take the case off to continue charging) - 2024, Sunday, March 3rd
- I did not play with my new case today, as I again forgot to use it. - 2024, Sunday, March 10th
- I played with my new case today. It helped significantly. - 2024, Sunday, March 17th
- I played with my new case again today. It helped significantly. - 2024, Sunday, March 24th to 2024, Sunday, November 24th
- I played with my new case again today. It helped significantly, although the case is now falling apart, and causing some sensitivity issues. There were power button issues during gameplay, where I randomly turned screen off a few times. - 2024, Sunday, December 1st

### Bring back the old UI

- I still miss the old UI. There should at least be an option to toggle the classic UI. - 2024, Sunday, January 7th

#### What I mean by the old UI:

> The ability to see how a building/troop/upgrade looks, and its statistics, without forcing a preview of how it performs in battle.
